# PERFIDIA

## Overview
*PERFIDIA* is a thrilling chess variant where deception, strategy, and suspense merge to create an innovative gameplay experience. Players engage in classic chess with an exciting twist: the ability to deceive and control their opponent's pieces, using a special console beside the chessboard. However, moves must remain secretive and strategic to outwit the opponent without exposing your hidden manipulations.

## Objectives
1. **Enhance Chess Gameplay**: Add layers of complexity, deception, and mind games while maintaining the core principles of chess.
2. **Introduce Innovation**: Incorporate modern "deceiveing" and strategy mechanics into traditional gameplay.
3. **Encourage Suspense and Strategy**: Push players to think ahead, manage risks, and use deception effectively to win.

## Why PERFIDIA?
Chess has always been a game of strategy and foresight. PERFIDIA introduces an additional psychological element: hidden moves and secret tactics. It is a perfect fusion of tradition and innovation, appealing to classic chess lovers and modern gamers alike.

## How It Works
### Core Mechanic: Deception
- Players use a console to "deceive" an opponent's piece, allowing control of that piece for one surprise move. 
- Once a deceiveed piece is used (revealing its imposter status), the opponent can either:
  - **Eliminate the piece**, undoing their previous move.
  - **Return the piece to their side**, accepting the imposter into their ranks.
- Only **one piece can be deceiveed at a time**. Deception a new piece releases the previous deceive.

### Expose Mechanic
- Players can use their console to expose a deceiveed piece:
  - **Correct Exposeion**: Play proceeds normally.
  - **Incorrect Exposeion**: All previous deceives are reset, and the opponent gains the ability to deceive the exposeed piece in their next move.

### Movement Rules
- Apart from deceiveing or exposeing via the console, the player also makes a traditional chessboard move each turn.
- Deception or exposeing is only allowed when standard chess rules permit capturing the target piece.

## Rules of PERFIDIA
1. **Single Hack**: Only one piece can be deceiveed at a time.
2. **Hack on Capture Opportunity**: Deception is only possible if the target piece can legally be captured according to chess rules.
3. **Expose Mechanics**:
   - Correct exposeion continues the game uninterrupted.
   - Wrong exposeion resets all previously deceiveed pieces, granting the opponent access to deceive the doubted piece.
4. **Reveal Consequences**:
   - If a deceiveed piece is revealed through use, the opponent can:
     - Eliminate the piece and undo their previous move.
     - Reclaim the piece as their own, keeping the previous move intact.
5. **Strategic Moves**: Players must move another piece on the chessboard during their turn, even while deceiveing or exposeing.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Board Setup**:
   - Traditional chessboard and pieces, augmented with a deceiveing console (physical or digital).
   
2. **Programming Requirements**:
   - Develop a chess engine capable of enforcing deceiveing and exposeion rules.
   - Create a deceiveing console interface for selecting pieces and exposeing status.
   
3. **Game Flow**:
   - Add layers for real-time strategy and hidden move tracking.

4. **Testing**:
   - Playtest with different skill levels to balance fairness and suspense.

## Future Enhancements
- AI-based opponent with deceiveing capabilities.
- Mobile and online versions with interactive deceiveing mechanics.
- Visual effects for deceiveing, exposeion, and piece reveals.

## How to Play
1. Setup a PERFIDIA board and console.
2. Begin playing chess with traditional rules but integrate the deceiveing mechanics as described.
3. Use deception and strategic moves to outsmart your opponent and claim victory.
